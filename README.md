## Setup:

### Prerequistes:
- [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Get started

Clone the repo and run the following commands:
- `nvm use` to select the node version<br/>(if you don't have the specified version, run `nvm install` beforehand)
- `yarn` to install all dependencies.
- `yarn start` to run the server

## Usage

### Marking
When the app is running and displyed on browser, on the *Mark!* section you can type or copy any text in the text container, which already has a default _*Lorem Ipsum*_ placeholder.<br/><br/>

After that, you can select one of the three colors and selecte some text with your mouse or trackpad. The text should be highllighted with the choosen color.<br/><br/>

If you want, you can click the highlighted text in order to remove the color from it.

### Filtering
On the *Filter!* section you can selected any combination of colors you want. Having any text highlighted in that color inside the container above, you should see all the words dipplayed for the selected colors on the right-hand side.

## P.S
Sorry folks at WAES, didn't have much time to polish things the way I wanted, but I did my best within the time frame.<br/><br/>
I know code documentation is requirement but I found it very simple to understand. For this reason, I make myself available to any clarification that might be needed by you guys.

Hope to hear from you soon!
